	<p class="p2"><br>Duration 3–4 days

	<br><br> Max Elevation: 3480m

	<br><br>Difficulty: Medium

	<br><br>Season: Mid-March to May, September to November

	<br><br>Start: Damnongchu or Merak

	<br><br>Finish: Thakthri or Jyongkhar

	<br><br>Access Town: Trashigang

	<br><br>    Summary: A star attraction offering a sneak peek into one of the most secluded regions in Bhutan.</p>
	<br><br>
	<p class="p3">
	Day 1: Damnongchu to Merak<br><br>
	The trail leading out of Damnongchu involves a series of gentle ups and downs along a stream. About 45 minutes before Merak you pass the village and lhakhang at Gengu, which is said to house the mummified body of Buchang Gyalwa Zangpo, the son of Thangtong Gyalpo.

	The final stretch is an easy and gradual ascent through yak meadows into the village of Merak (3480m), home to around 140 families. Camp is usually made just before the village, in a spot offering fantastic views of the mountains and the village. Alternatively, you can choose to stay at the village guesthouse or in a local homestay. The Samtenling Lhakhang boasts the saddle and phallus of local mountain deity Jomo Kuenkhar's horse.
<br><br>
	Time
	5 hours

	<br> Day 2: Merak to Miksa Teng<br><br>
	Today's trek scales the 4140m Nagchung La for fine Himalayan views, after which the route descends steadily to a river. After following the river for an hour, it's another steep one-hour climb and then descent to Miksa Teng (2850m; a teng is a ledge or terrace). The campsite is surrounded by rhododendrons, which are in riotous bloom in April.
<br><br>
	Time
	7–8 hours

	<br> Day 3: Miksa Teng to Sakteng<br><br>
	From Miksa Teng, climb 300m to a small pass, then descend through beautiful woods to Sakteng (2985m). If you're lucky, you might see a red panda amid the forest along the way. There's a campsite on the outskirts of the village, but you can also sleep at the village guesthouse if you want. Some groups include a rest day in Sakteng, which is a good idea.
<br><br>
	Time
	4 hours

	<br>
	 Day 4: Sakteng to Jyongkhar<br><br>
	After a small pass, today's walk is mostly downhill, to the village of Thakthri (2200m), which is connected by a new road to Rangjung and is where you can end the trek. Alternatively, you can cross the Gamri Chhu and continue to the village of Jyongkhar (1850m), which is linked by another road to Phongme, Radi and then Rangjung.
<br>
	Time
	6–7 hours

<br>
	The Shy Predator<br><br>
	Locally referred to as chen, the critically endangered snow leopard is a solitary and elusive creature that lives in rocky mountain folds above the tree line, descending to lower altitudes during winter. The snow leopard is extremely agile in high terrain, and can effortlessly move through nearly 1m of snow. Its dappled fur offers wonderful camouflage in its icy habitat. Preying on blue sheep and the occasional yak calf, it can sometimes stray into human territory in search of food. However, direct confrontations with humans are rare.
<br><br>
	The holy grail of an entire generation of wildlife photographers and filmmakers, the snow leopard remains one of the most pursued creatures in the wild. If you manage to spot one of these cats on your trek, consider yourself blessed.</p>
