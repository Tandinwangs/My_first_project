	<p class="p1">1.Table Tennis</p><br><img class="img1" src="tt.jpg"><br>
		<p class="p2">I have intense interest in Table Tennis since grade 7. The moment I saw some of the seniors playing table tennis, my interest for TT kicked off. There after I started practising it day and night. Though i wasn't selected as school team during my lower schoolings, my attentiveness for table tennis was never shattered. I picked-up playing it even during my high schools and it was the very moment where my dream came into reality.I got an opportunity to represent my school as a table tennis player there after. I won several times yet I reached at National level only once but it was the moment that gave me so much of happiness. There are some benefits of playing Table Tennis as following:</p>
		<li>Improving hand-eye coordination.</li>
		<li>Improving reflexes.</li>
		<li>It keeps your brain sharp.</li>
		<li>It improves balance. </li>

		<p class="p3">2. Listening To Music</p><br>
		<img class="img2" src="music.jpg"><br><br>
		<p class="p4">I am interested in listening to music and I believe that listening to music is an effective way to relief pain, reduce blood pressure and cure the heart. Although I do not play any musical instruments and hated some musical instruments such as violin, I still highly enjoy listening to music. In my free time I used to put my headphones on and suddenly I am in my own world. Also, I usually use this way to escape from the pressure of exams or hearing family problem, so music helps me to clear my head of negative thoughts and feelings. Moreover, I do not let a single day goes without listening to music. However, I am very cautious about what I listen to and I only listen to bands and songs that have meaningful words and do not have bad content which are against our culture and value. My favorite singers are Sonam Wangdi, Ugyen Panday and Namkha Lhamo. Furthermore, I like to read stories while I am listening to music because I think that music helps me to concentrate on the task at hand because it is so loud and drowns out the background noise.Additionally,listening to music inspires me to start writing some simple songs. Also,I used to introduce the songs ,which I have written, to my best friends in order to get their feedback and take advantages of them in the coming times when I write other songs.In fact, I love music because all of my family members love to listen to music.</p>

		<p class="p5">HTML is a markup language so it uses simple tags to markup and format the content. These tags are enclosed in angular brackets. Almost all the tags have their closing tags also. The html tag informs the browser that a HTML document has been started similarly /html tells the end of HTML document. All the things or code written inside these two tags are represented sent to the browser. The browsers then display the content wrapped inside the body tag.​HTML defines the format of how the web elements should be displayed. ​To see your content you need to save your file with. html or.htm extension and then simply run it by choosing the option to open with any browser.​ HTML is one of the best option to develop the webpage or website for the small or growing business that does not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does not require any advanced programming for their websites.</p>
