	<div class="paro"><br><p class="p1"> Paro, Bhutan</p><img src="taktsang.jpg"><br><br><p class="p2">Taktsang Monastery or Paro Taktsang, popularly known as Tiger’s Nest Monastery is located in the outskirts of Paro district in Western Bhutan. Paro Taktsang is basically a cluster of temples clinging to the edge of an impossibly steep and rocky cliff, seeming to hang in space some 800 metres above the valley. The monastery is located at an altitude of 3120 metres above sea level. Paro Taktsang is the most sacred Buddhist site in Bhutan. For a traveller, if there is one place you ought to visit in Bhutan, it is Taktsang Monastery.</p>

	<br><h5>History</h5><p class="p3"> It is said that a female disciple of Guru Padmasambhava transformed herself into a tigress and carried him on her back from Eastern Bhutan to the site of Paro Taktsang in the 8th century; hence the name Tiger’s Nest Monastery. Guru Padmasambhava assumed a wrathful form, Guru Dorji Drolo, and subdued the evil spirits in the temple’s locality. The tigress also resided in a cave at the temple site and owing to its fearful form helped to ward off evil spirits. At Tiger’s Nest, Guru Padmasambhava unveiled certain treasures for the benefit of sentient beings. He meditated at the Paro Taktsang for 3 years, 3 months, 3 days and 3 hours and emerged in the eight incarnated forms. You can still see the cave where Guru Padmasambhava meditated in 747 AD. Hence, the monastery is also sometimes referred to as ‘Temple of Guru with Eight Names’.
	<br><br>
	In 1998, Paro Taktsang was destroyed in a fire, the cause of which remains a mystery. All the precious religious images and relics were charred to cinders, and centuries of art, history and tradition were consumed swiftly by the flames. It was then painstakingly rebuilt over 7 years, exactly as it was, with almost every Bhutanese citizen contributing to its reconstruction, in cash or in kind. The charred remains of the precious old images were interred in new images that were made. It was a very special day when the new Paro Taktsang was consecrated on 24 Mar 2005, a symbol of Bhutanese resilience and faith. Surprisingly, the ceremony was conducted by a little boy who is believed to be the young reincarnation of the Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye – the one who had originally built the monastery three centuries earlier.
